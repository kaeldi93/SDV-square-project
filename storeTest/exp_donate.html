        It costs approximately $40,000 over a two year period to raise, train, and place a successful service dog. We have, on average, 25 dogs in various stages of training at any given time. Through the generous support of caring individuals, businesses and foundations, Service Dogs of Virginia is able to provide service dogs at no cost to those in need.
